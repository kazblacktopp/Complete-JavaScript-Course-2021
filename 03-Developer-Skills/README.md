Given an array of forecasted maximum temperatures, the thermometer displays a string with the given temperatures.

### Example:

```
[17, 21, 23]
```

will print

```
"... 17ºC in 1 days ... 21ºC in 2 days ... 23ºC in 3 days ..."
```

### Your tasks:

1. Create a function `printForecast` which takes in an array `arr` and logs a string like the above to the console. Try it with both test datasets.
2. Use the problem-solving framework: Understand the problem and break it up
   into sub-problems!

### Test data:

**Data 1**:

```
[17, 21, 23]
```

**Data 2**:

```
[12, 5, -5, 0, 4]
```
