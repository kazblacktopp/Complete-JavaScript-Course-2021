## Welcome! üëãüèΩ

Here you will find the instructions for all the coding challenges for the `JavaScript Fundamentals Part 2` section of the Udemy course [The Complete JavaScript Course 2021: From Zero to Expert!](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/), created by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/).

Each coding challenge can be executed using the [index.html](./index.html) file in the [01-Fundamentals-Part-2](../01-Fundamentals-Part-2) directory.

The `<script>` line for each challenge has been included at the bottom of the `<body>` section of the `index.html` file so you will need to comment out the scripts that you don't need.

Back to the two gymnastics teams, the Dolphins and the Koalas! There is a new gymnastics discipline, which works differently.

Each team competes 3 times, and then the average of the 3 scores is calculated (so one average score per team).

A team only wins if it has at least double the average score of the other team. Otherwise, no team wins!

### Your tasks:

1. Create an arrow function `calcAverage` to calculate the average of 3 scores.
2. Use the function to calculate the average for both teams.
3. Create a function `checkWinner` that takes the average score of each team as parameters (`avgDolhins` and `avgKoalas`), and then logs the winner to the console, together with the victory points, according to the rule above.

**Example**: 

```
"Koalas win (30 vs. 13)"
```

4. Use the `checkWinner` function to determine the winner for both **Data 1** and **Data 2**.
5. Ignore draws this time.

### Test data:

**DATA 1**: Dolphins score 44, 23 and 71. Koalas score 65, 54 and 49

**DATA 2**: Dolphins score 85, 54 and 41. Koalas score 23, 34 and 27
