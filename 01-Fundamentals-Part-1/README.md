# Code Challenges for JavaScript Fundamentals - Part 1

![JavaScript Fundamentals - Part 1 Coding Challenges](../images/js-fundamentals1.jpg)

## Welcome! üëãüèΩ

Here you will find the instructions for all the coding challenges for `JavaScript Fundamentals Part-1`.

## Coding Challenge #1

### Instructions

Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI(Body Mass Index) which is calculated using the following formula - (mass in kg and height in meters):

`BMI = mass / (height ** 2)`

OR

`BMI = mass / (height * height)`

### Your tasks

1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables.

2. Calculate both their BMIs using the above formula (you can even implement both versions).

3. Create a Boolean variable `markHigherBMI` containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

### Test data

DATA 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall.John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.

DATA 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall.John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.

## Coding Challenge #2

### Instructions

Use the BMI example from `Coding Challenge #1`, and the code you already wrote, and improve it.

Your tasks:

1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!".

2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs.Example: "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!".
